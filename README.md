# Welcome to My Machine Learning Journey in Financial Data Analysis

Over the next three months, I'll be diving deep into a **Machine Learning** course designed to enhance not only my ML skills but also my ability to apply them specifically to financial data analysis. I’m thrilled to share every part of this journey—assignments, insights, and my growing toolkit—right here with you all. 📘✨


This isn't just any course—it's an in-depth exploration covering key ML topics, tailored to deliver actionable insights for financial data professionals like me. Here’s a peek into some core modules and how I’ll be leveraging them for finance:

- **📊 [Machine Learning for Regression](https://github.com/TeslimAdeyanju/my-portfolio-ml-zoomcamp-2024-cohot/tree/main/1-Machine%20Learning%20for%20Regression)**  
  _Application:_ Predicting trends in financial data, such as asset prices, loan performance, or risk-adjusted returns. Regression models will serve as the backbone for analyzing linear relationships in transaction-heavy datasets.

- **🏷️ [Machine Learning for Classification](https://github.com/TeslimAdeyanju/my-portfolio-ml-zoomcamp-2024-cohot/tree/main/2-Machine%20Learning%20for%20Classification)**  
  _Application:_ Enhancing classification models to identify financial risk factors or customer churn—an essential task in risk management, fraud detection, and customer retention strategies.

- **🧮 [Evaluation Metrics for Classification](https://github.com/TeslimAdeyanju/my-portfolio-ml-zoomcamp-2024-cohot/tree/main/3-Evaluation%20Metrics%20for%20Classification)**  
  _Application:_ Optimizing model evaluation through precision, recall, and other metrics tailored for financial insights. This is crucial for balancing model performance and accuracy in high-stakes scenarios, like credit scoring.

- **🚀 [Deploying Machine Learning Models](https://github.com/TeslimAdeyanju/my-portfolio-ml-zoomcamp-2024-cohot/tree/main/5-Deployment)**  
  _Application:_ Building real-time deployment pipelines, allowing my financial models to run in production environments for continuous, on-demand analysis—ideal for applications like credit scoring or risk assessment tools.

- **🌳 [Decision Trees and Ensemble Learning](#6-decision-trees-and-ensemble-learning)**  
  _Application:_ Using ensemble methods to capture complex patterns in financial data, providing robust models for portfolio risk analysis and investment strategy optimization.

- **🤖 [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](#8-neural-networks-and-deep-learning)**  
  _Application:_ Applying deep learning techniques to model non-linear financial data trends, such as predicting stock movements or identifying complex customer behavior patterns.

- **☁️ [Serverless Deep Learning](#9-serverless-deep-learning)**  
  _Application:_ Leveraging serverless architectures for scalable model deployment in financial forecasting, making it easier to handle large-scale transaction data in real-time.

- **🛠️ [Kubernetes and TensorFlow Serving](#10-kubernetes-and-tensorflow-serving)**  
  _Application:_ Ensuring efficient, scalable deployment of financial models with Kubernetes, critical for large transaction datasets that require continuous monitoring and updates.

## My Approach: Learning in Public

I’m a huge believer in the power of **Learning in Public**, and my goal is to create a valuable resource for anyone navigating financial data analysis with ML. Here, I’ll share:

- **Detailed notes** 📓 that break down complex concepts
- **Projects and code samples** 🧑‍💻 designed for real-world applications
- **Case studies** 📈 applying ML directly to financial datasets

This learning journey is powered by **DataTalks.Club**. If you’re also on this path, I recommend tapping into the **Slack community** for support. The `#course-ml-zoomcamp` channel is an amazing space for guidance, questions, and brainstorming sessions with others in the field!
