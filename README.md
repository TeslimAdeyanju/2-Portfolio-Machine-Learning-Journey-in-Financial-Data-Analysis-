<h1>Welcome to My Machine Learning Journey </h1>
Over the next three months, I’ll be diving deep into an exciting **Machine Learning** course, and I’m thrilled to share my progress, assignments, and notes with all of you. 📘✨

This isn’t just another course—it's a full-on adventure that takes on key ML topics, like:

- 📊 [Machine Learning for Regression](https://github.com/TeslimAdeyanju/my-portfolio-ml-zoomcamp-2024-cohot/tree/main/1-Machine%20Learning%20for%20Regression)
- 🏷️ [Machine Learning for Classification](https://github.com/TeslimAdeyanju/my-portfolio-ml-zoomcamp-2024-cohot/tree/main/2-Machine%20Learning%20for%20Classification)
- 🧮 [Evaluation Metrics for Classification](https://github.com/TeslimAdeyanju/my-portfolio-ml-zoomcamp-2024-cohot/tree/main/3-Evaluation%20Metrics%20for%20Classification)
- 🚀 [Deploying Machine Learning Models](https://github.com/TeslimAdeyanju/my-portfolio-ml-zoomcamp-2024-cohot/tree/main/5-Deployment)
- 🌳 [Decision Trees and Ensemble Learning](#6-decision-trees-and-ensemble-learning)
- 🤖 [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](#8-neural-networks-and-deep-learning)
- ☁️ [Serverless Deep Learning](#9-serverless-deep-learning)
- 🛠️ [Kubernetes and TensorFlow Serving](#10-kubernetes-and-tensorflow-serving)

I’m a huge believer in the magic of **Learning in Public**, and I hope these shared resources—notes, projects, and code—will inspire and help anyone who’s walking the same ML path! 🧑‍💻🔗

This amazing journey is brought to you by **DataTalks.Club**, and trust me, if you're also taking the course, the absolute best way to get support is through their **Slack community**. Jump into the `#course-ml-zoomcamp` channel for guidance, answers, and discussions!

📢 **Pro tip**: For smooth conversations in Slack:
- Follow the **DataTalks.Club community guidelines** 📝
- Be clear when asking for help (context is everything!)
- And most importantly, let's all be kind and patient.

Let’s learn, grow, and crush this journey together! 💥
