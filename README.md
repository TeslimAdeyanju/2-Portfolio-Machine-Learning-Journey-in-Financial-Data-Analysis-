# My Machine Learning Journey in Financial Data Analysis

Over the next three months, I’ll be diving into **DataTalks.Club’s ML Zoomcamp**, a course designed to deepen my skills in machine learning for finance. I’ll be sharing key insights, projects, and code here with you all! 📘✨

## Here’s What I’ll Be Covering:

- **📊 Regression:** For predicting financial trends, like asset prices or loan performance.
- **🏷️ Classification:** Identifying risks or customer churn, key for risk management and retention.
- **🧮 Evaluation Metrics:** Optimizing precision, recall, and more for financial model accuracy.
- **🚀 Model Deployment:** Building pipelines for production-ready models in finance.
- **🌳 Decision Trees & Ensemble Learning:** Robust models for portfolio risk and investment strategy analysis.
- **🤖 Neural Networks:** Modeling complex financial patterns like stock movements.
- **☁️ Serverless Deep Learning:** Scalable deployments for real-time transaction analysis.
- **🛠️ Kubernetes:** Efficient deployment for high-volume financial data.

## Learning in Public

I’m committed to **Learning in Public**—sharing detailed notes, real-world code samples, and financial ML case studies. If you’re on this journey too, the **DataTalks.Club Slack** (`#course-ml-zoomcamp`) is an incredible resource for support and collaboration.

Let’s make an impact in financial data analysis together! 💥
