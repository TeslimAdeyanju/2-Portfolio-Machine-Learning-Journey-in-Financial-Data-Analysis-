# My Machine Learning Journey in Financial Data Analysis

Over the next three months, I’ll be diving into **DataTalks.Club’s ML Zoomcamp**, a course designed to deepen my skills in machine learning for finance. I’ll be sharing key insights, projects, and code here with you all! 📘✨

## Here’s What I’ll Be Covering:

- 🗒️ [Regression:](https://github.com/TeslimAdeyanju/my-portfolio-ml-zoomcamp-2024-cohot/tree/main/1-machine-learning-for-regression) For predicting financial trends, like asset prices or loan performance.
- 🗓️ [Classification:](https://github.com/TeslimAdeyanju/my-portfolio-ml-zoomcamp-2024-cohot/tree/main/2-machine-learning-for-classification) Identifying risks or customer churn, key for risk management and retention.
- 🧮 [Evaluation Metrics:](https://github.com/TeslimAdeyanju/my-portfolio-ml-zoomcamp-2024-cohot/tree/main/3-evaluation-metrics-for-classification) Optimizing precision, recall, and more for financial model accuracy.
- ♻️[Model Deployment:](https://github.com/TeslimAdeyanju/my-portfolio-ml-zoomcamp-2024-cohot/tree/main/5-machine-learning-deployment) Building pipelines for production-ready models in finance.
- **🌳 Decision Trees & Ensemble Learning:** Robust models for portfolio risk and investment strategy analysis.
- **🤖 Neural Networks:** Modeling complex financial patterns like stock movements.
- **☁️ Serverless Deep Learning:** Scalable deployments for real-time transaction analysis.
- **🛠️ Kubernetes:** Efficient deployment for high-volume financial data.
